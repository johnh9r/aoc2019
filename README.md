Advent of Code 2019
===================

This repository contains my solutions to the daily tasks of this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problem solving and coding challenge.  Some problems proved too hard or tedious to solve, so a couple of days are missing altogether along with several second parts of problems.

Programming Language
--------------------
All solutions are written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) 1.9.x -- deliberately chosen for a sustained learning experience.  All work is my own, and it was created without consulting any websites, forums, or fellow competitors.  Please bear in mind that much of this source code was written in a hurry (with a view to a private leadership board):  More sophisticated approaches and more elegant Elixir code are available elsewhere. ;-)

Almost all source code can be executed with `mix test` to verify the solutions to both parts of the daily problem.  Some (raw) source code still contains debug output, and in a very small number of cases, the solution is only reported in this manner (for reasons of convenience at the time of submission).

Repository
----------
The `raw` branch contains all my solutions with the source code in the state as it was when answers were submitted to the AoC website.  Over time, cleaned up source code might correspondingly appear on the `master` branch, but no promises.  As this is predominantly a personal record and not for collaboration, force pushes are fair game.
